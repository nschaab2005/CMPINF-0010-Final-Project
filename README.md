In this repository, we tried to choose the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on quality of life, which we measured by three submetrics: median home value, arrest rates, and public greenspace.

Description and links to the datasets used:
1. Parks Data Set #1: This is the data set that displays all of the public greenspace in Pittsburgh (including traffic medians, neighborhood parks, etc.) and classifies them by neighborhood.
